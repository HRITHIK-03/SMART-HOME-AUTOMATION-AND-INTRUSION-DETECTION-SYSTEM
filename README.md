# SMART-HOME-AUTOMATION-AND-INTRUSION-DETECTION-SYSTEM

In today’s world, Smart Home Systems are making everyday life easier day by 
day. Be it automatic fan operating system or temperature controlling systems, or 
light switch on/off systems and specially intrusion detection systems. All of this 
can be controlled via a mobile device at user’s end and they can control all of this 
at the tip of their hand. Such is our Home Automation & Intrusion Detection System, which takes inputs 
from various sensors placed strategically all over the home and centrally 
controlled with the help of a microcontroller. It is optional to see the backend 
working/data of such model on mobile devices.


Using various sensors, this system will turn ON lights automatically when 
 someone enters a room and consecutively turns OFF the lights and fan if everyone 
 leaves the room, i.e., no one is in the room.
 This will also include a counter system so that the automation may work best 
 while saving electricity when no one is in the room. Counting will be done using 
 2 independent IR sensor modules.
 The fans will work automatically when the temperature will rise above 27 degrees 
 Celsius. Temperature will be measured using LM35 IC sensor.
 This system will also have a intrusion detection system which will work if no one 
 is in the room, i.e., count is zero, and someone tries to enter the room 
 unconventionally. Working is based on HC-SR501 PIR motion detection sensor.  Overall, this project will be based on Arduino based microcontroller and all of 
 this will be placed in a cardboard box representing a room in real life and will be 
 powered by a laptop for demonstration purpose. The results will be visible both 
 physically as well as on the serial monitor of the laptop screen.
